# Menus and keys

Everything the port adds on top of the game, reachable with a controller or the keyboard. The
menus come from the `feature/portal-menu` branch of the skylanders-portal fork
(`thirdparty/skylanders-portal/src/portal_rex/`), the same as in SwapForceRecomp and SSARecomp;
they share one look and hide all input from the game while they are open. They speak the language
the game runs in.

| What | Controller | Keyboard | Setting |
|---|---|---|---|
| Portal menu: put Skylanders, sidekicks and items on the portal | Guide (Xbox), Back + Start, hold Back | F6 | `portal_menu_open_buttons`, `bind_portal_menu` |
| Portal overview: what is on the portal, taken off one by one (the item too) without lifting the Skylander | Back + Y | F5 | `portal_item_off_buttons`, `bind_portal_item_off` |
| Player menu: which controller is which player | L3 + R3, or F4 > Portal > "Open the player menu" | F9 | `player_menu_buttons`, `bind_player_menu` |
| Settings menu | Back + RB | F4 | `settings_menu_buttons`, `bind_settings_menu` |
| Achievements | F4 > Game > Achievements | F7 | `bind_achievements` |
| Quit or restart the game (both ask first, "No" chosen) | F4 > Game > "Quit the game" / "Restart the game" | Alt+F4 | |
| All settings (developer list of the SDK) | from the settings menu, last page | F10 | `bind_settings` |
| Debug overlay (FPS) | | F3 | `bind_debug_overlay` |

Button entries are comma-separated: a button (`guide`, `back`, `start`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `lb`,
`rb`, `ls`, `rs`, `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`), a chord joined with `+`, or `hold_<button>`.

## Portal menu

Opens by itself when the game asks a player for a Skylander (see [portal.md](portal.md)), or with
the buttons above. It lists the figures of Spyro's Adventure and Giants by element, everything with
the game's own pictures, read at run time from the owner's disc:

- **Portraits:** the collection screen's portrait of every Skylander and variant (Series 2,
  LightCore, Legendary and the alternate decos), of the sidekicks and of the magic items
  (`src/game/toy_portraits.cpp`); the element symbols from the card game.
- **Names:** magic items and adventure packs as the game calls them, in its language
  (`src/game/game_text.cpp`).
- **Details (X):** the upgrades as the game's upgrade screen lists them, with names, descriptions,
  prices and pose pictures, the bought ones marked (`src/game/toy_upgrades.cpp`); the hat with
  the game's name, picture and bonuses (`src/game/toy_hats.cpp`).

The full description of the menu is in SwapForceRecomp's
[menus.md](https://github.com/tsapZ/SwapForceRecomp/blob/main/docs/menus.md).

## Portal check

Opens by itself on the game's "too many" screens: it lists the figures on the emulated portal, A
marks one to take off, Continue takes them off. See [portal.md](portal.md#portal-check).

## Settings menu

`portal_rex/settings_menu.cpp` draws the menu; `src/settings_pages.cpp` describes its pages:

- **Graphics:** preset (Performance: scale 1 + FSR; Quality: scale 2 + CAS; Best: scale 3 + CAS),
  internal resolution (`resolution_scale`), sharpening (`present_effect`), texture filtering
  (`anisotropic_override`), HD textures on or off (`hd_textures`, with a pack installed), extra edge smoothing (`swap_post_effect`), fullscreen, window size.
- **Frame rate:** `frame_rate_limit` (0 = 30 FPS like the console; higher values let the game run
  at that rate, its speed stays the same), VSync, render path, graphics card, graphics interface
  (D3D12 or Vulkan).
- **Game:** language (automatic, English, German, French, Spanish, Italian), skip the logo movies,
  skip the opening movie.
- **Portal:** virtual / both / USB / none (`portal_mode`), the portal menu opening by itself, only
  my figures.
- **Controls:** the menu buttons, each with a few choices, keyboard and mouse, which player the
  keyboard is.
- **Keyboard, Controller:** the keyboard's key for each controller button; what each controller
  button does in the game (`pad_map_a` ... `pad_map_rs`, e.g. a shoulder button doing B's job) and
  how strongly each player's controller vibrates (`pad_rumble_p1` / `_p2`, 10 % steps, the
  controller buzzes at each change; SwapForceRecomp #71, #73).
- **Advanced:** opens the SDK's list of every setting (F10).

LB / RB switch the page, up / down pick a setting, left / right change it, **Y saves** into
`giantsrecomp.toml` (only the changed lines), B closes. For test runs `--config_file=<path>` makes
the app use another settings file.
